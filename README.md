# Bovine Facial Recognition System

## Overview
This system provides facial recognition capabilities for cattle identification using deep learning techniques. It implements a complete pipeline from image capture to individual bovine identification using state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms.

## Key Features
- Real-time facial detection using RetinaFace
- Feature extraction and matching using ArcFace
- High accuracy bovine identification (95%+ in controlled environments)
- Support for multiple camera inputs
- Database integration for cattle records
- Performance monitoring and analytics

## Technical Architecture
The system consists of several key components:
1. Image Acquisition Module
2. Face Detection (RetinaFace)
3. Feature Extraction
4. Classification (ArcFace)
5. Database Management
6. Analytics Dashboard

## Requirements

### Hardware
- NVIDIA GPU with 8GB+ VRAM
- Storage: 2TB minimum for datasets
- Cameras: 1920x1080 resolution @ 30fps minimum

### Software
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- OpenCV
- SQLite3
- Additional dependencies in requirements.txt

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/bovine-facial-recognition.git

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```python
from bovine_recognition import BovineRecognizer

# Initialize the recognizer
recognizer = BovineRecognizer()

# Process an image
result = recognizer.identify('path/to/image.jpg')
```

### Database Operations
```python
# Add new bovine
recognizer.add_bovine(bovine_id='BOV001', name='Cow1', breed='Nelore')

# Query records
records = recognizer.get_recognition_history('BOV001')
```

## Performance Metrics
- Processing Time: <2 seconds per image
- Accuracy: 95%+ in controlled environments
- False Positive Rate: <1%
- Capacity: 100-200 animals (first phase)
